# Testing the Canton Snap with Middleware (Local Development)

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. MetaMask Flask

**MetaMask Flask is required.** Local snaps are a developer feature rejected by the standard MetaMask extension. Once the snap is published to npm and passes MetaMask's snap review process, a regular MetaMask install will suffice.

> **Browser profile:** Run MetaMask Flask in a **dedicated browser profile** that does not have the standard MetaMask extension installed. Both extensions inject `window.ethereum` and conflict with each other — the dApp will behave unpredictably if both are active in the same profile.

### 2. Node.js

```bash
node --version   # v18 or higher
```

### 3. Middleware

Clone the [canton-middleware](https://github.com/ChainSafe/canton-middleware) repo and start the local stack:

```bash
make docker-up     # start Canton ledger + PostgreSQL + middleware API
make docker-down   # stop and remove containers
```

Verify the API is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/health
# Expected: OK
```

---

## Setup

```bash
npm install

cp packages/snap/.env.example packages/snap/.env
cp packages/dapp/.env.example packages/dapp/.env
```

Edit each `.env` as needed. For local snap dev set `VITE_SNAP_ID=local:http://localhost:4040` in `packages/dapp/.env`; the port must match `VITE_SNAP_PORT` in `packages/snap/.env` (default: `4040`).

If the middleware stack has read-endpoint auth enabled (an `auth` block in its api-server config), the SIWE sign-in message must match that config's `domain`/`uri`. The local docker stack expects `localhost` / `http://localhost`, while the dev server runs on port 3000, so also set in `packages/dapp/.env`:

```bash
VITE_SIWE_DOMAIN=localhost
VITE_SIWE_URI=http://localhost
```

---

## Starting the Dev Servers

```bash
npm run build          # build snap + dApp
npm run serve          # start snap (4040) + dApp (3000) together

# Or individually:
npm run serve:snap     # http://localhost:4040
npm run dev:dapp       # http://localhost:3000
```

Open the dApp at **http://localhost:3000** — in the browser profile where MetaMask Flask is installed.

---

## Architecture

The snap signs the 32-byte transaction hash returned by the middleware — it never contacts the middleware directly.

## dApp Pages

The UI guides users through the flow. Pages in order:

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Landing** | Connect MetaMask wallet |
| **Registration Choice** | Choose Custodial or Non-Custodial mode |
| **Custodial Registration** | One-click: middleware holds your Canton key |
| **Non-Custodial Registration** | Install snap → sign registration → submit |
| **Registration Done** | Party ID and fingerprint confirmed |
| **Dashboard: Profile** | Party details, key mode, snap version and install status |
| **Dashboard: Balances** | ERC-20 token balances for the registered Canton party |
| **Dashboard: Transfer** | Send tokens to another Canton party via the snap |
| **Dashboard: Activity** | ERC-20 transfer history (requires relayer — see Limitations) |

---

## Registration: Whitelist Requirement

Before an address can register, it must be whitelisted on the middleware. From the `canton-middleware` repo:

```bash
go run ./scripts/utils/whitelist.go --address <evm-address>
```

Registration will return an error until the address is whitelisted.

---

## Transfer Testing: Fund the Wallet

To test transfers, the Canton party must hold tokens. From the `canton-middleware` repo:

```bash
go run ./scripts/utils/fund-wallet.go --address <evm-address> --amount 1000 --token DEMO
```

---

## Tests

```bash
npm test              # crypto unit tests + snap integration tests
npm run test:snap     # snap integration tests only (jest + @metamask/snaps-jest)
```

---

## Current Limitations

**MetaMask Flask required** — Until the snap is published to npm and reviewed by MetaMask, only MetaMask Flask users can install it.

**Local snap mode** — Local development uses `local:http://localhost:4040` and requires MetaMask Flask. Published snap mode uses `npm:@moonsonglabs/canton-snap` with standard MetaMask.

**Each developer runs their own snap server** — The `local:` snap ID is bound to localhost; teammates cannot share one instance.

**Activity tab requires relayer/bridge** — The Activity UI is built and reads ERC-20 transfer logs from the Canton EVM RPC. Populating real transaction history depends on the relayer or bridge being deployed and indexing events. This is the primary remaining integration work.

---

## TODO

- **Relayer / bridge integration** — Deploy and connect the relayer or bridge so the Activity tab has real transaction history to display. The UI and log-fetching logic are complete on the dApp side.
